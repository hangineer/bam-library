This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## The example of Nextjs x Panda-css

[Panda-css](https://panda-css.com/)
Panda is a styling engine that generates styling primitives to author atomic CSS and recipes in a type-safe and readable manner.

Panda combines the developer experience of CSS-in-JS and the performance of atomic CSS. It leverages static analysis to scan your JavaScript and TypeScript files for JSX style props and function calls, generating styles on-demand (aka Just-in-Time)

TLDR; Panda is a CSS-in-JS engine that generates atomic CSS at build time (via CLI or PostCSS)

Support:

- Support server/client side render component
- Support design token integration
- Support Type-Safety
- Support Used in any JavaScript framework.
